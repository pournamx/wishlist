# 🎁 My Wish List Website

This is a personal wish list website built using **only HTML and CSS**, with a small touch of **JavaScript** to make it editable right in the browser!

You can click on the "**Toggle Edit Mode**" button and edit any section of the site — like typing directly into a notebook. It's a fun, beginner-friendly project that showcases my dream tech gadgets, travel destinations, books to read, and life goals.
